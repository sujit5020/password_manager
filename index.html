        <h1>Password Managers</h1>
        <p>A password manager is an essential tool designed to help users securely store and manage their passwords for various online accounts. By encrypting passwords and storing them in a centralized database, it ensures that users can access their credentials with a single master password, eliminating the need to remember multiple complex passwords. This not only enhances security by encouraging the use of strong, unique passwords for each account but also improves convenience by autofilling login details on websites and apps. Advanced password managers often include features like password generation, breach monitoring, and two-factor authentication support, providing a robust defense against cyber threats and unauthorized access.</p>
